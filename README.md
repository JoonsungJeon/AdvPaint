This repository contains the official implementation of **AdvPaint**, a novel defensive framework that generates adversarial perturbations that effectively
disrupt the adversary’s inpainting tasks. We will be presenting AdvPaint at _ICLR 2025_ in Singapore. Check out the project page and the paper!
